  FastLED
	FastLED  ; Grabs the "official" FastLED library.
	; However here we have additional flexibility in that we can pull
	; from github as well for the main branch or specific branches or commits.
	; Here is an example of pulling from the master branch of FastLED library.
	;
	; FastLED=https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED
	;
	; Here's an example of pulling from a specific branch of FastLED library.
	;
	; FastLED=https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED#somebranch
	;
	; For example, if you make a fix in the FastLED library in a forked repo
	; then you can pull from your forked repo like this.

	; FastLED=https://github.com/yourusername/FastLED

; --- Serial monitor settings ---
; Adjust to match Serial.begin(...) in your sketch

; --- Upload/monitor port (Linux) ---
; If auto-detection fails, set your serial device explicitly, e.g.:
; upload_port = /dev/ttyACM0
; monitor_port = /dev/ttyACM0
; Tip: find ports with: ls /dev/ttyACM* /dev/ttyUSB* 2>/dev/null
